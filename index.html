                Hello Internet!  <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        My name is Noah Feinberg, and I'm a recent graduate in computer engineering 
                at the University of Illinois Champaign Urbana. I'm interested in graphics, artificial intelligence, 
                and security. I hope that one day I will be able to make a game that my friends and I can enjoy as 
                a fun distraction. When I'm not busy working, I enjoy playing video games, cooking, and gardening.

                        For the last two summers of college I chose to work for fulcrum-gt a consulting and management 
                        company that is know for its integration of SAP into its software. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        For the first summer I worked in a group with four other interns building a vacation planning
                        application. We built a iphone application that generated a schedule for user based on a users 
                        preference settings. In order to adjust the preferences apropriatly we created a basic learning 
                        algrothem to change a user's hidden profile based on if the user attended certain events. We also
                        created a "on the go" mode which recommended events for a user to attend that were near them. 
                        I was responsible for developing the data structures to hold users data and the REST api both of 
                        which were created using TypeScript and Node.js.
                        <br><br>
                        The secound summer I worked on fulcrum's new product, a work flow management system. I specifically
                        worked on a server to scrap sanction lists for a conflict searching software. I also worked on
                        normalizing the sanction data so it could be processed by elsatic search. After finishing my work 
                        on conflict searching I worked on implementing metrics tracking libarys so that optimization tests
                        could be performed.

                        For my first internship I worked with Dr. Anthony Solomonides as a research intern for NorthShore 
                        University HealthSystem. While working under Dr. Solomonides I analyzied patient data in order to 
                        generate statistics for use as evidence in a COPD study of patient release care. I also created several
                        programs in Microsoft Visual basic to assist in the modification of Excel data sheet. For example 
                        one program I wrote took unique Identifiers for each patient and data fields for each known patient of
                        a study and re-identified all patients of a given test group. This was accomplished by matching anonymous
                        patient and recorded data for known patients of a study.
