                Hello! my name is Max Feinberg, and I'm a senior in aerospace engineering
                at the University of Illinois Champaign Urbana. I'm interested in robotics,
                artificial intelligence, and computer vision. I really want to make robots
                that improve people's lives and make difficult, labor intensive tasks easier.
                When I'm not tinkering, I enjoy cooking and listening to live music.

                        I worked with the Intelligent Robotics Group at NASA Ames on the free-flying
                        robot,Astrobee. I developed a bootloader for the dsPIC33EP512MC806 microcontroller
                        by Microchip that is to be used on the perching arm subsystem of the robot. I also
                        designed and implemented a variety of reliability tests for the propulsion and perching
                        arm systems. In addition to those tests, I also conducted a series of tests on
                        LEDs to determine the viability of implementing a visual signaling system on the robot.

                        I assisted two undergraduate students with their surgery related research projects. One
                        of the studies examined the safety of a gastric bypass after a sleeve gastroplasty. The
                        other study compared various laparoscopic vessel sealing energy devices. For my help in
                        their research I was named one of the main authors in both studies, which were published
                        in the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons(SAGES) journal.

                        I developed software utilized in an embedded encoder monitoring system that employed
                        cloud computing for data analysis and data visualization. I designed and conducted
                        thermal and battery tests for the prototype encoder system. I also began development
                        on a mesh network system to help with implementation of the new encoders in
                        extreme industrial settings. I also designed tools and fixtures that facilitated encoder
                        construction. I used 3D printers on a daily basis to rapidly iterate through designs.
